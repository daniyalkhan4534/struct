# structure-in-c

Data of various types are compiled into a single unit using structures. It gets rid of one of the main drawbacks of arrays, which is that they can only contain data components of similar types.Therefore, structures can be utilised in scenarios when diverse data types need to be saved as a single entity, such as ; a student record containing data elements like name, roll number, marks, etc.

Structure Declaration:-

Syntax

struct<structure_name>

{

<data_type> member1;

<data_type>member 2;

.

.

<data_type> membern;

}var1;

struct <structure_name> var2;

Structure Initialization

Syntax

structure_variable1.member1=value;

structure_variable2.member2=value;
